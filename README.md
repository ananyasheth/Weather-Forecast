### Weather Prediction Model
#### Introduction
This is a weather prediction model designed to provide accurate weather forecasts based on historical weather data. The model is built using logistic regression, a statistical method that is commonly used for binary classification problems.

#### Methodology
The goal of this model is to accurately predict the weather condition (e.g. sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.) for a given location, based on a set of input features (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.). Logistic regression was chosen as the method for building the model due to its ability to model the relationship between a set of independent variables and a binary dependent variable.

The process of building the weather prediction model can be broken down into the following steps:

Data Collection: The first step in building the model was to collect a large dataset of weather data for a given location. This data includes the input features (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) and the corresponding weather condition for each day.

Data Preprocessing: The next step was to preprocess the data. This included cleaning the data to remove any missing or incorrect values, and normalizing the data to ensure that all the features have similar ranges.

Model Training: The preprocessed data was then used to train the logistic regression model. The model was trained by finding the optimal coefficients (b0, b1, b2, ..., bn) that minimized the loss function.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was then evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy in predicting the weather condition.

Model Deployment: Finally, the trained model was deployed for use, allowing users to input their own weather features and receive a prediction of the corresponding weather condition.

#### Mathematical Foundation
The mathematical foundation of logistic regression lies in the concept of the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. The logistic function maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. The output of the logistic regression model is a probability of a given weather condition, given the input weather features.

The logistic regression model is formulated as:

p(y=1|x) = 1 / (1 + e^-(b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn))
where p(y=1|x) is the probability of the weather condition being 1 (e.g. sunny) given the input weather features x. The b values are the coefficients learned by the model during training, and x are the input weather features.

The loss function used to train the logistic regression model is the binary cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual weather condition. The binary cross-entropy loss is formulated as:

$$ J(w) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} [y^{(i)} \log (h_w(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log (1 - h_w(x^{(i)}))]

where y is the actual weather condition (0 or 1) and p(y=1|x) is the predicted probability of the weather condition being 1. The goal of training the model is to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss, which can be achieved by adjusting the coefficients b.

#### Conclusion

The weather prediction model is a tool that uses logistic regression to make accurate weather forecasts based on historical weather data. The process of building the model involves collecting and preprocessing weather data, training the logistic regression model, evaluating its accuracy, and deploying it for use. The mathematical foundation of the model involves the logistic function and the binary cross-entropy loss function, which are used to calculate the probability of a given weather condition based on input weather features and to minimize the difference between the predicted probability and the actual weather condition.

# Weather Prediction Model

This repository contains a weather prediction model that uses logistic regression to make accurate weather forecasts based on historical weather data.

## Mathematical Foundation

The mathematical foundation of the model involves the logistic function and the binary cross-entropy loss function, which are used to calculate the probability of a given weather condition based on input weather features and to minimize the difference between the predicted probability and the actual weather condition.

The binary cross-entropy loss function is given by the following equation:

$$ J(w) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} [y^{(i)} \log (h_w(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log (1 - h_w(x^{(i)}))] $$

where `m` is the number of samples, `w` is the weight vector, `h_w(x)` is the predicted probability that the sample belongs to class 1 (also known as the sigmoid function), `y` is the true label of the sample, and `x` is the feature vector.

The goal of training the logistic regression model is to find the weights `w` that minimize the cost function `J(w)`.
